# Mailtrap .NET client

This library offers integration with the [official API](https://api-docs.mailtrap.io/) for [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io).
It is extensible, so far offering the possibility to asynchronously send an email.
It targets .NET Standard, so it can be used in both .NET Framework and .NET. 

## Usage

### Minimal

```cs
using Mailtrap;

/**
 * For this example to work, you need to set up a sending domain,
 * and obtain a token that is authorized to send from the domain.
 */


const token = "<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>";
const senderEmail = "<SENDER@YOURDOMAIN.COM>";
const recipientEmail = "<RECIPIENT@EMAIL.COM>";

var mailtrapClient = new MailtrapClient(token);

var mail = new Mail
{
    To = new List<Address> { new Address { Email = senderEmail, Name = "John Doe" } },
    From = new Address { Email = recipientEmail, Name = "Example Sales Team" },
    Subject = "Your Example Order Confirmation",
    Html = "<p>Congratulations on your order no. <strong>1234</strong>.</p>",
    Category = "API test"
};

mailtrapClient.SendAsync(mail).Wait();
```

### Creating the MailtrapClient

As seen in the example above, the simplest method is passing the token directly to the constructor, which can be used in .NET Framework and .NET:
```cs
var mailtrapClient = new MailtrapClient(token);
```

By using the dependency injection build into .NET, the MailtrapClient service can be registered using the following extension method:
```cs
builder.Services.AddMailtrap();
```

This approach offer more flexibility, since the MailtrapClient configuration is retrieved from the application settings:
```json
  "Mailtrap": {
    "Token": "<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>",
    "AuthorizationType": "ApiKey",
    "SendingEnpoint": "<CUSTOM-SENDING-ENDPOINT>"
  }
```

Refer to the [`examples`](examples) folder for the source code of this and other advanced examples.

### Nodemailer Transport

> NOTE: [Nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) is needed as a dependency.

```sh
yarn add nodemailer

# or, if you are using NPM:
npm install --s nodemailer
```

If you're using Typescript, install `@types/nodemailer` as a `devDependency`.

```sh
yarn add --dev @types/nodemailer

# or, if you are using NPM:
npm install --s-dev @types/nodemailer

You can provide Mailtrap specific keys like `category`, `customVariables`, `templateUuid` and `templateVariables`.

```
