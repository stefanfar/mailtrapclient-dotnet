# Mailtrap .NET client

This library offers integration with the [official API](https://api-docs.mailtrap.io/) for [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io).
It is extensible, so far offering the possibility to asynchronously send an email.
It targets .NET Standard 2,0, so it can be used in both .NET, .NET Core and .NET Framework (4.6.1 or higher). 

## Usage

### Minimal

```cs
using Mailtrap;

/**
 * For this example to work, you need to set up a sending domain,
 * and obtain a token that is authorized to send from the domain.
 */

const token = "<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>";
const senderEmail = "<SENDER@YOURDOMAIN.COM>";
const recipientEmail = "<RECIPIENT@EMAIL.COM>";

var mailtrapClient = new MailtrapClient(token);

var mail = new Mail
{
    To = new List<Address> { new Address { Email = senderEmail, Name = "John Doe" } },
    From = new Address { Email = recipientEmail, Name = "Example Sales Team" },
    Subject = "Your Example Order Confirmation",
    Html = "<p>Congratulations on your order no. <strong>1234</strong>.</p>",
    Category = "API test"
};

mailtrapClient.SendAsync(mail).Wait();
```

### Creating the MailtrapClient

As seen in the example above, the simplest method is passing the token directly to the constructor, method which can be used in .NET Framework and .NET:
```cs
var mailtrapClient = new MailtrapClient("<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>");
```

By using the dependency injection build into .NET, the MailtrapClient service can be registered using the following extension method:
```cs
builder.Services.AddMailtrap();
```

This approach offers more flexibility, since the MailtrapClient configuration is retrieved from the application settings:
```json
  "Mailtrap": {
    "Token": "<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>",
    "AuthorizationType": "ApiKey",
    "SendingEnpoint": "<SENDING-ENDPOINT>"
  }
```

Alternatively, the configuration can be provided using the options pattern:
```cs
builder.Services.AddMailtrap(options =>
{
    options.Token = "<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>";
    options.SendingEnpoint = "<SENDING-ENDPOINT>";
    options.AuthorizationType = AuthorizationType.BearerAuth;
});
```

Refer to the [`DotNETFrameworkConsoleApp`](DotNETFrameworkConsoleApp) and [`DotNETWebApplication`](DotNETWebApplication) projects for examples of how to use the service.

### Retry mechanism

In the case that the sending request fails with a status code >= 500 (server errors) or status code 408 (request timeout), the sending is retried one more time.

### Logging

MailtrapClient uses the ILogger interface, received through dependency injection, allowing the configured logging provider to receive logs from the mailing service.

## Notes

The token is required when creating an instance of MailtrapClient, and should be provided to the constructore in one of the three possible ways: the 'token' parameter, settings or options.
There are two types of authorization which can be configured: Api-token and Bearer authorization.
When working with a .NET application, it is recommended to register the library in configuration through the provided extension method, due to known limitations of HttpClient, which is used behind the scenes (['Guidelines for using HttpClient'](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient-guidelines))
